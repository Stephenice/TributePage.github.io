                <p>Martin Luther King, Jr. was a social activist and Baptist minister who played a key role in the
                    American civil rights movement from the mid-1950s until his assassination in 1968. King sought
                    equality and human rights for African Americans, the economically disadvantaged and all victims of
                    injustice through peaceful protest. He was the driving force behind watershed events such as the
                    Montgomery Bus Boycott and the 1963 March on Washington, which helped bring about such landmark
                    legislation as the Civil Rights Act and the Voting Rights Act. King was awarded the Nobel Peace
                    Prize in 1964 and is remembered each year on Martin Luther King, Jr. Day, a U.S. federal holiday
                    since 1986.</p>

                    <h2>When Was Martin Luther King Born?</h2>
                    <p>Martin Luther King, Jr. was born on January 15, 1929, in Atlanta, Georgia, the second child of
                        Martin Luther King Sr., a pastor, and Alberta Williams King, a former schoolteacher.</p>
                    <p>
                        Along with his older sister Christine and younger brother Alfred Daniel Williams, he grew up in
                        the city’s Sweet Auburn neighborhood, then home to some of the most prominent and prosperous
                        African Americans in the country.</p>
                    <blockquote cite="https://www.history.com/topics/black-history/martin-luther-king-jr#section_9">
                        Did you know? The final section of Martin Luther King, Jr.’s eloquent and iconic “I Have a
                        Dream” speech is believed to have been largely improvised.
                    </blockquote>
                    <p>
                        A gifted student, King attended segregated public schools and at the age of 15 was admitted to
                        Morehouse College, the alma mater of both his father and maternal grandfather, where he studied
                        medicine and law. </p>
                    <p>
                        Although he had not intended to follow in his father’s footsteps by joining the ministry, he
                        changed his mind under the mentorship of Morehouse’s president, Dr. Benjamin Mays, an
                        influential theologian and outspoken advocate for racial equality. After graduating in 1948,
                        King entered Crozer Theological Seminary in Pennsylvania, where he earned a Bachelor of Divinity
                        degree, won a prestigious fellowship and was elected president of his predominantly white senior
                        class.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        King then enrolled in a graduate program at Boston University, completing his coursework in 1953
                        and earning a doctorate in systematic theology two years later. While in Boston he met Coretta
                        Scott, a young singer from Alabama who was studying at the New England Conservatory of Music.
                        The couple wed in 1953 and settled in Montgomery, Alabama, where King became pastor of the
                        Dexter Avenue Baptist Church.

                    <p>
                        They had four children: Yolanda Denise King, Martin Luther King III, Dexter Scott King and
                        Bernice Albertine King.

                    <h2>Montgomery Bus Boycott</h2>
                    <p>The King family had been living in Montgomery for less than a year when the highly segregated
                        city became the epicenter of the burgeoning struggle for civil rights in America, galvanized by
                        the landmark Brown v. Board of Education decision of 1954.</p>
                    <p>
                        On December 1, 1955, Rosa Parks, secretary of the local chapter of the National Association for
                        the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), refused to give up her seat to a white passenger on a
                        Montgomery bus and was arrested. Activists coordinated a bus boycott that would continue for 381
                        days, placing a severe economic strain on the public transit system and downtown business
                        owners. They chose Martin Luther King, Jr. as the protest’s leader and official spokesman.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        By the time the Supreme Court ruled segregated seating on public buses unconstitutional in
                        November 1956, King—heavily influenced by Mahatma Gandhi and the activist Bayard Rustin—had
                        entered the national spotlight as an inspirational proponent of organized, nonviolent
                        resistance.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        King had also become a target for white supremacists, who firebombed his family home that
                        January.

                    <h2>Southern Christian Leadership Conference</h2>
                    <p>Emboldened by the boycott’s success, in 1957 he and other civil rights activists—most of them
                        fellow ministers—founded the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC), a group committed
                        to achieving full equality for African Americans through nonviolent protest.</p>
                    <p>The SCLC motto was “Not one hair of one head of one person should be harmed.” He would remain at
                        the helm of this influential organization until his death.</p>
                    <p>In his role as SCLC president, Martin Luther King, Jr. traveled across the country and around the
                        world, giving lectures on nonviolent protest and civil rights as well as meeting with religious
                        figures, activists and political leaders.</p>
                    <p>During a month-long trip to India in 1959, he had the opportunity to meet family members and
                        followers of Gandhi, the man he described in his autobiography as “the guiding light of our
                        technique of nonviolent social change.” King also authored several books and articles during
                        this time.</p>

                <div id="four" class="section-contain">
                    <h2>Letter from Birmingham Jail</h2>
                    <p>In 1960 King and his family moved to Atlanta, his native city, where he joined his father as
                        co-pastor of the Ebenezer Baptist Church. This new position did not stop King and his SCLC
                        colleagues from becoming key players in many of the most significant civil rights battles of the
                        1960s.</p>
                    <p>Their philosophy of nonviolence was put to a particularly severe test during the Birmingham
                        campaign of 1963, in which activists used a boycott, sit-ins and marches to protest segregation,
                        unfair hiring practices and other injustices in one of America’s most racially divided cities.
                    </p>
                    <p>Arrested for his involvement on April 12, King penned the civil rights manifesto known as the
                        “Letter from Birmingham Jail,” an eloquent defense of civil disobedience addressed to a group of
                        white clergymen who had criticized his tactics.</p>

                    <h2>March on Washington</h2>
                    <p>Later that year, Martin Luther King, Jr. worked with a number of civil rights and religious
                        groups to organize the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom, a peaceful political rally
                        designed to shed light on the injustices African Americans continued to face across the country.
                    </p>
                    <p>Held on August 28 and attended by some 200,000 to 300,000 participants, the event is widely
                        regarded as a watershed moment in the history of the American civil rights movement and a factor
                        in the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.</p>
                </div>
                <div id="six" class="section-contain">
                    <h2>I Have a Dream</h2>
                    <p>The March on Washington culminated in King’s most famous address, known as the “I Have a Dream”
                        speech, a spirited call for peace and equality that many consider a masterpiece of rhetoric.</p>
                    <p>Standing on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial—a monument to the president who a century earlier
                        had brought down the institution of slavery in the United States—he shared his vision of a
                        future in which “this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed: ‘We hold
                        these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal.'”</p>
                    <p>The speech and march cemented King’s reputation at home and abroad; later that year he was named
                        “Man of the Year” by TIME magazine and in 1964 became the youngest person ever awarded the Nobel
                        Peace Prize.</p>
                    <p>In the spring of 1965, King’s elevated profile drew international attention to the violence that
                        erupted between white segregationists and peaceful demonstrators in Selma, Alabama, where the
                        SCLC and Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) had organized a voter registration
                        campaign.</p>
                    <p>Captured on television, the brutal scene outraged many Americans and inspired supporters from
                        across the country to gather in Alabama and take part in the Selma to Montgomery march led by
                        King and supported by President Lyndon B. Johnson, who sent in federal troops to keep the peace.
                    </p>
                    <p>That August, Congress passed the Voting Rights Act, which guaranteed the right to vote—first
                        awarded by the 15th Amendment—to all African Americans.</p>
                </div>
                <div id="seven" class="section-contain">
                    <h2>Assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr.</h2>
                    <p>The events in Selma deepened a growing rift between Martin Luther King, Jr. and young radicals
                        who repudiated his nonviolent methods and commitment to working within the established political
                        framework.</p>
                    <p>As more militant black leaders such as Stokely Carmichael rose to prominence, King broadened the
                        scope of his activism to address issues such as the Vietnam War and poverty among Americans of
                        all races. In 1967, King and the SCLC embarked on an ambitious program known as the Poor
                        People’s Campaign, which was to include a massive march on the capital.</p>
                    <p>On the evening of April 4, 1968, Martin Luther King was assassinated. He was fatally shot while
                        standing on the balcony of a motel in Memphis, where King had traveled to support a sanitation
                        workers’ strike. In the wake of his death, a wave of riots swept major cities across the
                        country, while President Johnson declared a national day of mourning.</p>
                    <p>James Earl Ray, an escaped convict and known racist, pleaded guilty to the murder and was
                        sentenced to 99 years in prison. He later recanted his confession and gained some unlikely
                        advocates, including members of the King family, before his death in 1998.</p>
